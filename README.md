#digital-forensics-lab
Hands-on forensic investigation labs using FTK, Autopsy, and CLI tools
🛡️ Digital Forensics Investigation Lab  
Yeshiva University | Hands-On Lab Series via Cengage | Jan – May 2024

🎯 Objective  
Completed a structured digital forensics lab series simulating breach investigations across multi-OS environments. Built practical expertise in evidence handling, attack reconstruction, and compliance reporting.

🔧 Tools & Environments  
FTK Imager, Autopsy, Sleuth Kit, Wireshark, Command-Line Forensics  
Systems: Windows, Linux, macOS (NTFS, EXT4, APFS)

🔍 Core Capabilities Demonstrated  
- Performed forensic acquisition of live and static systems using industry tools  
- Applied memory and registry forensics, file carving, and metadata analysis  
- Reconstructed incident timelines by correlating artifacts across OS platforms  
- Maintained chain-of-custody protocols and created court-admissible documentation  
- Delivered reports aligned with **NIST SP 800-86** and legal standards

💡 Key Takeaway  
> Correlating registry data, system logs, and carved file artifacts helped trace attacker movement across Windows and Linux systems — a critical skill for SOC and incident response roles.

 📈 Role Relevance  
- 🛡️ SOC Analysts: Threat reconstruction, timeline generation  
- 📋 GRC/Compliance: Evidence reporting, policy-aligned documentation  
- ⚖️ E-Discovery Teams: Chain-of-custody, forensic investigation process
